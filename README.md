## It's cool but not that informative
For now there's not much information that we can collect, we can perhaps
c onclude that the weaker players ofte play the queen, for example, to the more obvious d1-h5
diagonal instead of placing in c2 or d2.

## Diferences between players 
## For the future
A more useful/interesting data would be the logarithm diferencies between each
player suares.
Also restricting the search for only the x amount of moves would be more
meaningful than not reducing.
