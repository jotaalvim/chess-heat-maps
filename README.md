The darker the color means that a peace have been moved there more times.

This are the heatmaps from the knigth, bishop, queen, rooks , pawns and the king, respectively, in the player's white games.

## It's cool but not that informative
For now there's not much information that we can collect, we can perhaps
conclude that the weaker players doen't care so much for king safety and place them it in the center very often.

## For the future
A more useful/interesting data would be the logarithm diferencies between each
player suares.
Also restricting the search for only the x amount of moves would be more
meaningful than not reducing.
